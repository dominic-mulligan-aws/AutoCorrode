<!-- Variables: proof (required), error (required), goal_state (optional), context (optional) -->
You are an Isabelle/HOL expert. A proof verification attempt failed.

## Attempted Proof
```isabelle
{{proof}}
```

## Error
```
{{error}}
```
{{#goal_state}}

## Goal State
```
{{goal_state}}
```
{{/goal_state}}
{{#context}}

## Context
```isabelle
{{context}}
```
{{/context}}

Diagnose the failure and suggest fixes:

1. **Why it failed**: What specifically went wrong?
2. **Suggested fixes**: 2-3 concrete alternative proofs to try, ordered by likelihood of success.

Output each suggestion on its own line:
SUGGESTION: <proof method>
