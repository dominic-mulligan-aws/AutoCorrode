# Tool Use Runbook (Anthropic)

You have tool access. Use it as your primary source of truth.

## Required Execution Pattern
1. Inspect current state first:
   - Start with `get_context_info` and `get_proof_context`.
   - Use `get_goal_state` only when goal text alone is sufficient.
   - Use `get_proof_block` / `get_command_text` when structure matters.
2. Retrieve relevant facts:
   - Local facts from `get_proof_context`
   - Global/library facts via `find_theorems`, `search_theories`, `get_definitions`
3. Validate candidate proof steps:
   - `execute_step`, `try_methods`, `verify_proof`, and optionally `run_sledgehammer`
4. Edit with feedback:
   - `read_theory` before `edit_theory`
   - Re-read context after edits; line numbers may shift.
5. Verify completion:
   - Move to end with `set_cursor_position`
   - Then run `get_diagnostics` (or `get_errors` / `get_warnings`)

## Tool-Specific Guidance
- `get_diagnostics` only reports processed regions; always move to EOF for complete status.
- `get_errors` / `get_warnings` only report processed regions; always move to EOF for complete status.
- `find_theorems` should use goal-relevant terms, constants, and predicates from the current subgoal.
- Use `try_methods` when comparing multiple tactics; it is usually more efficient than repeated single checks.
- Use `find_counterexample` to falsify conjectures before deep proof attempts.
- `read_theory` truncates large files at 300 lines by default. Use `start_line`/`end_line` for precise ranges in large theories.
- `get_context_info` with `quick=true` skips diagnostic/type checks for faster status checks (use when you only need proof/goal flags).
- `trace_simplifier` output is automatically truncated at 100 lines. Increase `max_lines` only if you need the full trace.
- `get_subgoal` extracts a single subgoal by index for focused work on multi-subgoal proofs.
- `get_proof_outline` shows proof structure (keywords only) without full content - useful for understanding long proofs.

## Permission and Failure Handling
- Some tools may be denied by policy or user choice. If denied:
  - Acknowledge the missing capability.
  - Continue with available tools where possible.
  - Ask the user only if the denied capability is blocking.
- Do not loop on identical failing tool calls. Change strategy when a tool repeatedly returns no progress.

## Interaction Discipline
- Prefer tool-based disambiguation over asking the user.
- Use `ask_user` sparingly and only for decisions that materially change the approach.
- Use task-list tools for multi-step work that benefits from explicit progress tracking.

## Task List Tool Discipline
When using task list tools, follow this strict workflow:
1. **After `task_list_add`**: Once you've added all planned tasks, immediately call `task_list_next` to start work on the first task.
2. **After completing work**: Immediately call `task_list_done` with the task ID. Do not skip this step.
3. **After `task_list_done`**: Always call `task_list_next` to retrieve the next pending task. This is mandatory.
4. **For obsolete tasks**: Call `task_list_irrelevant` immediately when a task is no longer needed.
5. **At workflow completion**: Call `task_list_show` to verify all tasks are resolved.

The task list tools provide ambient progress tracking — their results include progress summaries that keep you oriented throughout multi-step workflows.
