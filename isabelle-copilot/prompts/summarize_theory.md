<!-- Variables: theory_name (required), source (required) -->
Summarize this Isabelle/HOL theory for documentation purposes.

## Theory: {{theory_name}}

```isabelle
{{source}}
```

Provide a structured summary covering:

1. **Purpose**: What is the overall goal of this theory? (1-2 sentences)
2. **Main Definitions**: List key definitions, datatypes, and type synonyms with brief descriptions
3. **Key Theorems/Lemmas**: List the most important results with their informal meaning
4. **Proof Techniques**: What proof methods are predominantly used? (e.g., induction, case analysis, automation)
5. **Dependencies**: What theories does this build on, and what concepts does it import?

Be concise but precise. Use Isabelle notation where helpful. If the theory is part of a larger development (e.g., separation logic, µRust verification), note how it fits into that context.

If the source appears truncated or very large, focus on the visible portion and note that the summary may be incomplete.
